# Blocks: web components for the Uploadcare platform integrations

## üíé Core concepts

- All in one place: here, you can find everything you need to build a modern and reliable web application with Uploadcare on board.
- Modern technologies: web components, service workers, wasm, and other cutting edge web standards are ready to show their power.
- Type safety with a JSDoc declaration and TypeScript static analysis.
- Modern ESM-level code sharing.
- The build stage is unnecessary for development: use the code directly in any modern browser or node.js.
- Fast and secure.
- Minimum of external dependencies: security audit is not expensive.
- We try to be as close to the native web platform as possible and not force you to use any specific development environment tools.
- Tested by un Uploadcare community.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs in the box?

- [File uploader solutions](/solutions/file-uploader/) - file uploader implementations for the most frequent use cases.
- [Blocks to build your own custom solutions](/blocks/) - build your own integration solutions with simple HTML and CSS.
- [Adaptive image solution](/solutions/adaptive-image/): all you need to distribute your web images efficiently.
- [Cloud image editing solution](/solutions/cloud-image-editor/): tune your pictures on the fly.
- Web components for media content representation: audio, video, image galleries, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and start

Installation process is very easy and takes minutes.
See our [Installation guide](/get-started/installation/).

## Typescript support

We use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html" target="_blank">JSDoc type annotations</a> for TypeScript static analysis support during development.

Also, we provide type definitions (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html">\*.d.ts files</a>) for the TypeScript projects in our packages.

Check the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html">JSDoc Reference</a> page in TypeScript official documentation.

## Supported browsers

Blocks are supported and tested in all major modern desktop and mobile browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera
- etc.

<a target="_blank" href="https://uploadcare.com/blog/uploadcare-stops-internet-explorer-support/">Internet Explorer</a> is outdated and not supported anymore.

## Frameworks support

Blocks are a framework-agnostic solution, so you can use it with any runtime you like. We have prepared examples for most popular frameworks.
